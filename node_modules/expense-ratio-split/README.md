# Expense Ratio Split


A small React project created to run on a Raspberry Pi home server to calculate how much both me and my partner need to
put into our shared bank account each month.


In reality, an HTML templating system on a node server which gets its data from a file would be a better technical decision
as we could have shared state without the need of an export url.

But... I'm mainly doing this as an excuse to practice using React, so here we are :)
